He is not pretty, but he gets the job done.

This is my first keyboard that has a home grown pcb. It is wired as a unibody even though the electronics are in 3 pieces. I made it because I needed a simple keyboard that did not require i2c, to test out my custom firmware found here: https://github.com/StephanMoeller/zigmkay

The 3d model can be found here: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/7e18701322fe8efaf0180c4f/w/a36590332a2ae1251c32ad98/e/2509fc05bb245310630f5e48?renderMode=0&uiState=68a64716a2e5bb13277ed67f
An stl can be found directly in this repo (mike-typeson.stl)

To build this, the following things are needed:

- 3d printed case
- PCB
- THT diodes (30 pieces)
- Khailh mx sockets (30 pieces)
- A xiao rp2040 microcontroller
- 16 jumper wires with female dupont in both ends
